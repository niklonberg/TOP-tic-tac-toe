# Tic-Tac-Toe

A tic tac toe project, as part of The Odin Project's fullstack javascript learning path.  
Focus here was using the module pattern (IIFE's) and factory functions to encapsulate code,  
and prevent naming conflicts in larger applications. It promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.  
Using ES6 arrow syntax for functions, to get used to it.
